# Free-space-wiper
Very quick, basic piece of software to wipe free space on a drive, that can run on just bash. No other dependencies
or libraries necessary, as the aim was to have it run on android with bash installed

Dependencies: printf, cp, mkdir, sleep, rm, seq
Basically a rudimentary, dependency free version of sfill from secure-wipe

Always use the proper sfill when you can.
